### Sandbox for the healthcare.gov content api

Docs here: https://www.healthcare.gov/developers

- Open `index.html` directly in Chrome (it's empty, but the script fills it with content initially)
- right-click on the page and choose `inspect element`
- click on the `console` tab
- See the output from `script.js`
